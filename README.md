PlacePicker is a React-based web application that allows users to build a personal collection of places they wish to visit or have already visited. It features an interactive UI where users can select from a list of predefined scenic locations and manage their selected places. A modal confirmation dialog ensures accidental deletions are avoided. The project demonstrates use of useRef, useState, component-based structure, and custom modal handling in React.
